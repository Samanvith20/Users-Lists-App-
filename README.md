Usage
Searching for Users
To search for a user, use the search bar located at the top of the user list.

Start typing the user's name or any other search criteria.

As you type, the list of users will dynamically update to display only the users that match your search query.

Deleting Users
To delete a user from the list, locate the user you want to delete.

Click the "Delete" button next to the user's information.

A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes," or cancel by clicking "No."
